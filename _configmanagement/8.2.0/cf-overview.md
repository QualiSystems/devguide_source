Configuration management allows you to run operations on App VMs during their deployment in CloudShell sandboxes. Such operations may include installing an application or running some configurations on the VMâ€™s software or operating system. Configuration management operations can be configured using custom scripts and Ansible playbooks. Custom scripts are typically used for simple operations, like installing a program on the VM or printing some messages, while Ansible is used for more complex tasks.

### Developing configuration management

The flow for developing configuration management is as follows, with minor differences depending on whether you're using a script or playbook.

1) Write the script or playbook.

2) Manually simulate/debug the script or playbook.

3) Add the script or playbook to an App and deploy the App.
