_The Custom Cloud Provider feture is available in CloudShell 9.0._

In CloudShell 9.0, we added the capability to integrate with any private or public cloud provider, beyond the cloud providers we support out-of-the-box (vCenter, AWS EC2, Azure, and OpenStakck. This is done by creating a shell from the Cloud Provider standard, developing the interface with the cloud provider of your choice and adding the required automation. The standard may also be used to implement deployment of applications as part of deployment containers.

A cloud provider shell may include more than one deployment type, allowing a variety of options to base the virtual instance on (for example, selecting the image from the marketplace or loading a custom one).
