In this article, we'll learn how to set up the App's deployment paths.

The shell's deployment paths are defined in the shell project's **Deployments** folder. The folder includes a *deployment-path.yaml* file, which represents a single deployment path. You can create multiple deployment paths for your shell by creating additional copies of the file and modifying their settings.

Note that since Cloud Provider is a 2nd Gen shell, the deployment paths are not available in Resource Manager Client's **Resource Families** explorer.

### Setting the deployment path and image

Let's start by configuring a new deployment path. In the **Deployments** folder, open the *deployment-path.yaml*, and locate the following line:

{% highlight yaml %}
vendor.resource.MyDeploymentPath:
{% endhighlight %}

Replace "MyDeploymentPath" with the display name of the new deployment path. For example: "MyTestPath".

Install the shell on CloudShell and in the **Manage>Apps** page, create an App template. You should be able to see the new deployment option in the **Select Deployment Type** area:

![Resource information]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/cp-new-deployment-path.png){:class="img-responsive"}

We can also change the icon of the deployment path by placing the new image file in the **Deployments** folder and replacing *shell-icon.png* in the yaml's `artifacts:` section with the new file name.

For example, setting image file "MyTestPath-icon.png":

{% highlight yaml %}
artifacts:
  icon:
    file: MyTestPath-icon.png
    type: tosca.artifacts.File
{% endhighlight %}

### Adding attributes

Next, add the required attributes. 

_**Notes:**_
_You cannot modify attributes **type**, **name**, and any attributes that are associated with the shellâ€™s family as this will affect other shells that use this family. The family attributes are listed in the Cloud Provider Shell Standard._

_CloudShell does not allow upgrading shells with deleted/modified attributes. Therefore, if you need to make an unsupported change to an attribute (for example, deleting an attribute or changing its type), make sure to remove the shell from CloudShell before you install the updated version._ 

Place the cursor at the end of the `derived_from:` line and press the **[Enter]** key. Type "properties:" and press **[Enter]** again. Press the **[Tab]** key and add the attribute. _**To make the attribute visible to the user in CloudShell, make sure to include the "tags: [user_input]" line.**_ For example, adding a string attribute called "My attribute":

{% highlight yaml %}
vendor.resource.MyTestPath:
derived_from: cloudshell.nodes.CustomDeploymentOption
properties:
  My attribute:
    type: string       # supported types are: string, integer, float, boolean, cloudshell.datatypes.Password
    tags: [user_input]
{% endhighlight %}

The deployment path should look something like this:

![Resource information]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/cp-deployment-path-attribute-1.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Same as with attributes in the *shell-definition.yaml*, you can also specify additional details, like default value, description and possible values (`constraints` property). For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
My attribute:
  type: string
  default: value 1
  description: "This is my Networking type attribute."
  constraints: value 1, value 2, value 3
  tags: [user_input]
{% endhighlight %}

### Setting attributes as read only in the blueprint

In some cases, you may want a specific deployment attribute to be unavailable for editing from the blueprint, possibly because it defines critical VM properties, like the image ID or public IP. If this is the case, you can set the attribute to only be editable by the admin in the App template. To do so, add the `editable_only_in_app_template` rule to the attribute. For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
My attribute:
  type: string
  default: value 1
  description: "This is my Networking type attribute."
  constraints: value 1, value 2, value 3
  tags: [user_input, editable_only_in_app_template]
{% endhighlight %}

The attribute will be read only in the blueprint.

*Note that the `editable_only_in_app_template` rule only blocks admins from editing the attribute value in the blueprint but not in the sandbox, where the attribute is available for editing by design. Regular users cannot edit the attribute in blueprints and sandboxes.*
