This article guides you on how to create and develop an L1 switch shell.

The **L1 Switch Shell template** is a standardized python-based template that contains the structure and common predefined commands required from an L1 switch shell. Note that previous versions of the L1 shell were based on TCL. However, to simplify the development and maintenance, we changed the infrastructure to be python-based, which provides a standardized development experience similar to our other shells. Due to the implementation of the L1 switch infrastructure in CloudShell, importing this type of shell follows a unique procedure.

For step-by-step instructions on how to create, implement and use the L1 switch shell, see the readme file on the shell's GitHub <a href="https://github.com/QualiSystems/shell-L1-template" target="_blank">repository</a>.
