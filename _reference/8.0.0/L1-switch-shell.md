This article guides you on how to create and develop an L1 switch shell.

The <a href="https://github.com/QualiSystems/shell-L1-template" target="_blank">L1 Switch Shell template</a> is a standardized python-based template that contains the structure and common predefined commands required from an L1 switch shell. Note that previous versions of the L1 shell were based on TCL. However, to simplify the development and maintenance, we changed the infrastructure to be python-based, which provides a standardized development experience similar to our other shells. Due to the implementation of the L1 switch infrastructure in CloudShell, importing this type of shell follows a unique procedure, which is explained later on in this article.

### Creating the L1 switch shell

1) Create a new shell project:

{% highlight bash %}
$ shellfoundry new DriverName --template layer-1-switch
{% endhighlight %}

2) Create a new Python virtual environment in the project's folder. Specify the same python executable which is used by CloudShell.

{% highlight bash %}
virtualenv --python="c:\Program Files (x86)\QualiSystems\CloudShell\Server\python\2.7.10\python.exe" --always-copy .\cloudshell-L1-DriverName
{% endhighlight %}

3) Activate the project's virtualenv

{% highlight bash %}
.\cloudshell-L1-DriverName\Scripts\activate.bat
{% endhighlight %}

4) Edit and install requirements (from the new project folder):

{% highlight bash %}
$ pip install -r .\cloudshell-L1-DriverName\requirements.txt
{% endhighlight %}

5) Save your changes.

### Implementing the shell commands

1) Implement methods of the `DriverCommands` class in `<project_slug>/driver_commands.py`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the <a href="https://github.com/QualiSystems/shell-L1-template/blob/dev/DEVGUIDE.md" target="_blank">L1 shell Developer guide</a> and docstrings with description. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an example of an L1 shell with CLI usage you can refer to the <a href="https://github.com/QualiSystems/cloudshell-L1-mrv" target="_blank">cloudshel-L1-mrv</a> project. 

2) To debug the driver use the <a href="https://github.com/QualiSystems/shell-L1-template/blob/dev/DEBUGGING.md" target="_blank">L1 shell Debugging guide</a>.

3) Update the driver version and metadata in the shell's *version.txt* file.

### Installing the shell on CloudShell and compiling the driver executable

1) Copy the project's *Cloudshell-L1-DriverName* folder to the Quali Server's */Drivers* folder.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drivers folder's path is usually *C:\Program Files (x86)\QualiSystems\CloudShell\Server\Drivers*.

2) Compile the shell's exe file using your preferred bat to exe converter. For example, iExpress is provided with Windows 2000 and later. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure you give the exe the same name as the bat file (for example, *Cloudshell-L1-DriverName.exe*) and save it to your L1 driverâ€™s project folder.

### Testing in CloudShell

1) Use this help <a href="http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/8.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnct-Ctrl-L1-Swch.htm" target="_blank">article</a> to import the shell, create a resource, set the timeout period, Autoload and configure its physical connections.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Note:** When running Autoload (or any other shell command at a later time), the log files are created under the *~Server\Logs* folder

2) Build a blueprint with 2 resources and a route.

3) Reserve this blueprint and connect the route.
